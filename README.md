# Housing Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Housing Price Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques. Whether you are new to machine learning or an experienced practitioner, this repository provides two workshops to guide you through data wrangling and model selection.

## Project Overview

The Housing Price Prediction project involves predicting housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The project is currently structured into two workshops, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project.

## Workshops

1. **Workshop 1: Data Wrangling**
   - Introduction to the dataset
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Handling missing values and outliers

2. **Workshop 2: Model Selection and Machine Learning**
   - Introduction to machine learning models
   - Model selection criteria
   - Choosing an appropriate regression model
   - Model training and evaluation

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
